ANTS - Autonomous Network Task Scheduler
----
Essentially, this spawns dozens or more lightweight task watchdogs. This allows you to use filter-type applications to address a large task, 
but instead of dealing with a single host, you can use dozens or hundreds or even more hosts. Now, that HUGE task that would take your 
Workstation (Server/Whatever) hours can happen in a massively shorter period of time, and since filters are reusable, you can use this 
back-end in your CI processes, on Render/Raster Clusters, in your Big Data combing missions, as a Stream Processor in your ETL - whatever you can
write a filter for, this handles it in a robust and fault tolerant manner.
